Classes:

Tuple
- Represents one row of data, with a specified TupleDesc
- Has a RecordId
- Contains the actual data
- Fixed length

TupleDesc
- A schema, a list of (fieldType, optional fieldname)

fieldType
- Predefined, int and string, fixed length

RecordId
- PageId and tupleNo within the page

PageId
- TableId and PageNum within the table

DbFile
- Represents a table
- Can have different implementation to support different access method
- Usually put the page loading logic here, since the implementation varies for different access methods
- But when Operators use the DbFile, the pages needs to be managed by BufferPool

Page
- Regardless of the implementation of DbFile, each file must be physically divided into Pages
- Pages are cached and flushed by singleton BufferPool
- Different DbFile implementation has different Page implementation

HeapFile
- A kind of DbFile
- logically, just a list of unordered Tuples
- physically represented by a file on disk
- at loading time, specify TupleDesc for schema (but schema is not stored in the file)

HeapPage
- An array of slots, with a header
- Header is a bitmap of whether a slot stores a Tuple or empty
- Fixed size

Operator
- A step in the query plan
- Chained to perform the query operations
- Represents a type of relation algebra

SeqScan
- An operator that scans a table(DbFile)
- It calls DbFile's iterator, which iterate through HeapPages in the HeapFile, with help from HeapPage's iterator
- Pages are loaded one by one via BufferPool as the scan progresses
